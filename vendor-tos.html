</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>RENTAL AND SERVICES RATES &ndash; BEST PRICE GUARANTY</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">a. &nbsp;Vendor will determine the rental rates for Rentals and Services it lists through MARCO, which rates shall be the same as or lower than those provided at Vendor&rsquo;s physical location(s) or any website, mobile application, or in any advertising of any form or nature (collectively, &ldquo;Vendor Communication&rdquo;); provided, however, that no Rental shall be offered for less than One Dollar ($1.00).&nbsp; Vendor is obligated to provide the Rentals and Services to Customers at the rates displayed through MARCO and shall not change or add any further charges following Customer securing such Rentals and Services through MARCO.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>THE COMPANY&rsquo;S ROLE.&nbsp;</strong>The Company provides a platform for third-party vendors (&ldquo;Businesses&rdquo;) and Customers to market and complete product rentals and the contracting of services.&nbsp; Except as set forth in Section 7, the Company is not involved in the Transaction between Businesses and Customers.&nbsp; Neither the Company nor its affiliates are the Customer, renter or user of any Rentals and Services.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>TRANSACTION PROCESSING.&nbsp;</strong>Vendor authorizes the Company to use Stripe (<a href="http://stripe.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://stripe.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1491339561144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEx24OUd8HwbOOZSCC9rVEM4NM_GQ">stripe.com</a>), or any other payment processing service provider, for purposes of completing a Transaction, including, but not limited to, processing payments, refunds and adjustments, receiving and holding rental and service proceeds on Vendor&rsquo;s behalf through managed accounts, remitting proceeds to Vendor&rsquo;s bank account, and paying the Company its Fee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">a. &nbsp;If the Company uses Stripe to complete a Transaction with Vendor, Vendor agrees that (i) such Transaction is subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement (<a href="http://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1491339561144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHUYle5z5pf0UXNVqz9L-VZwXHSOw">stripe.com/us/connect-<wbr />account/legal</a>), as the same may be modified from time to time by Stripe (the &ldquo;Stripe Agreement&rdquo;), and (ii) Vendor will comply with all of the terms and conditions of the Stripe Agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">b. &nbsp;Our obligation to remit funds received by us on your behalf is limited to funds that we have actually received less amounts owed to us (including, but not limited to, the Fee), subject to chargeback, refund or reversal or withheld for anticipated claims in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">c. &nbsp;Vendor shall comply with all support and service standards for usage of MARCO provided from time to time by the Company to Vendor.&nbsp; If we, in our sole discretion, conclude based on information available to us or our affiliates that Vendor&rsquo;s actions and/or performance in connection with the MARCO Services may result in Customer disputes, chargebacks or other claims, then we may, in our sole discretion, delay initiating any remittances and withhold any payments to be made or that are otherwise due to you in connection with the MARCO Services or this Agreement until the completion of any investigation regarding Vendor actions and/or performance in connection with the MARCO Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">d. &nbsp;Vendor is expected to use its best efforts to complete all Transactions.&nbsp; Vendor shall cancel Rentals or Services only in accordance with Vendor&rsquo;s standard cancellation policies applicable to Vendor&rsquo;s non-MARCO customers.&nbsp; We reserve the right to seek reimbursement from Vendor if we, in our sole discretion, decide to reimburse or provide a refund to a Customer if Vendor does not complete a Transaction, Vendor does not promptly deliver Rentals or Services, we discover erroneous, fraudulent, or duplicate transactions, or receive a chargeback from a Customer&rsquo;s credit card issuer for the amount paid by the Customer for the Rentals and Services.&nbsp; Vendor bears the risk of credit card fraud in connection with the MARCO Services.&nbsp; We may obtain reimbursement of any amounts so owed by Vendor by deducting from future payments owed to Vendor, reversing any credits to the account of Vendor, or seeking such reimbursement from Vendor by any other lawful means.&nbsp; You authorize us to use any or all of the foregoing methods to seek reimbursement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">e. &nbsp;We reserve the right, upon termination of this Agreement or Vendor&rsquo;s use of the MARCO Services, to set off against any payments to be made to Seller, an amount determined by us to be adequate to cover chargebacks, refunds, adjustments or other amounts paid to Customers in connection with Vendor&rsquo;s use of the MARCO Services for a one-month period.&nbsp; At the end of such one-month period following termination, we will disburse to Vendor any amount not used to offset chargebacks, refunds, adjustments, or such other amounts paid to Customers, or seek reimbursement from Vendor via any of the means authorized in paragraph c. above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>INSURANCE.</strong> &nbsp;Vendor shall, at Vendor&rsquo;s expense, maintain a policy of Commercial General Liability Insurance covering Vendor against claims of bodily injury, personal injury and property damage (including loss of use thereof) arising out of Vendor&rsquo;s operations for limits of liability as is standard in Vendor&rsquo;s industry, as well as workers&rsquo; compensation and such other insurance as is commonly held by businesses of the same type as Vendor.&nbsp; Upon request of MARCO, Vendor shall promptly provide certificates of insurance evidencing Vendor&rsquo;s compliance with this Section 8, and if requested by MARCO, listing MARCO as an additional insured.</p>
