		<section class="terms-content">
			<p>These Terms of Use, together with the privacy policy available at <a href="getmarco.co/privacy"> www.getmarco.co/privacy </a> (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) and the rules, policies, terms and conditions set forth in, referred to and/or linked herein, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, are, collectively, the &quot;Agreement&quot;.</p>

			<p>This Agreement constitutes a legal agreement between you (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;User&quot;) and Somerset Networks, Inc. a Delaware corporation d/b/a MARCO (&quot;MARCO&quot; or &quot;us&quot;). This Agreement governs your use of our services and platform that facilitates communications between Users offered through the MARCO mobile application offered by us (the &quot;App&quot;), and our website located at <a href="getmarco.co"> www.getmarco.co </a>, as it may be modified, relocated and/or redirected from time to time (the &quot;Site&quot;). Our services, platform, App, and Site are collectively referred to as the &quot;Platform&quot;.</p>
			
			<p><strong>By using any portion of the Platform you agree to be bound by this Agreement, as it may be amended by us from time to time in our sole discretion.</strong> We will post a notice on the Platform any time the Agreement has been changed or otherwise updated. It is your responsibility to review this Agreement periodically, and if at any time you find this Agreement unacceptable, you must immediately cease all use of the Platform. Continued use of the Platform after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. If you are using the Platform on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to this Agreement for that organization and representing to MARCO that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement (in which event, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; will refer to that organization) unless that organization has a separate Vendor Listing Agreement or other contract in effect with us, in which event the terms of that contract will govern your use of the Platform to the extent of any conflict between such contract and this Agreement.<strong> IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST NOT USE THE PLATFORM OR ANY PART THEREOF</strong>. If you require any more information or have any questions about this Agreement, please feel free to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:support@getmarco.co">support@getmarco.co</a>.</p>
			
			<p>By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are at least 18 years old, are at least of the legally required age in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and are otherwise capable of entering into binding contracts; and (ii) you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and that you will so abide. Where you enter into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to act on behalf of that entity and to bind that entity to this Agreement. </p>
			
			<p>If you use the App or other software provided by us, its use is governed in one of two ways: if you're presented with a separate license terms that you must accept in order to use the App or other software, those terms apply; if no separate license is presented to you, these Terms apply.

						<p><strong>1. The Platform is Solely a Venue for Communications.</strong></p>
			
			<p>a. The Platform is Solely a Venue for Communications. The Platform is a communications platform for enabling the connection between individuals seeking to obtain products or services for rent (&quot;Customers&quot;) and/or individuals seeking to provide products or services for rent (&quot;Vendors&quot;). Customers and Vendors together are referred to as &quot;Users&quot;. Those certain rental or other services requested by Customers of Vendors, which are to be completed by Vendors, are hereinafter referred to as &quot;Services&quot;. MARCO does not itself provide Services. The provision of all Services is up to Vendors, which may be scheduled through use of the Platform. MARCO, THROUGH THE PLATFORM, OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO OBTAIN SUCH SERVICES, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES ITSELF OR ACT IN ANY WAY AS A PROVIDER OF SUCH SERVICES, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY VENDORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A WARRANTY OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICE, WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE.</p>
			
			<p>b. You should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with any person whom you do not know. BY USING THE PLATFORM, YOU AGREE TO HOLD MARCO FREE FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LIABILITY OR DAMAGE THAT MIGHT ARISE OUT OF THE SERVICES. MARCO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER, WHETHER VENDORS OR CUSTOMERS, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SERVICES.</p>
			
			<p><strong>2. Personal Information; User Accounts.</strong></p>
			
			<p>a. Collection of your Personal Information. Some of the materials available on the Platform may require prior registration to access. If you decide to access such materials you will be required to register. We may refuse to grant you, and you may not use, a user name, email address or screen name that is already being used by someone else; that may be construed as impersonating another person; that belongs to another person; that violates the intellectual property or other rights of any person; that is offensive; or that we reject for any other reason in our sole discretion. When you complete a registration with us, you will be required to provide certain personal information. You agree that such information will be true, accurate and complete, and that you will update this information promptly when it changes. If you provide any information that is untrue or inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or if we suspect that your information is untrue or inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we may, in our sole discretion, suspend or terminate your right to access any material for which registration is required. Any personally identifiable information supplied hereunder will be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<p>b. Account, Password and Security. You are the sole authorized user of your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any username, password and account provided by you or us for accessing the Platform. You are solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account, except that MARCO may, in certain circumstances, enter your account to make changes that you request, such as rescheduling a Service appointment. MARCO has no control over the use of any User's account by the User or third parties and expressly disclaims any liability derived therefrom. Should you suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your password or account or you suspect any other breach of security, you must contact us immediately at  <a href="mailto:support@getmarco.co"> support@getmarco.co</a>. Nothing in this section shall affect MARCO's rights to limit or terminate the use of the Platform, as provided below in section 4(b).</p>
			
			<p>c. Proof of Identity. You will provide us with such proof of identity as we may reasonably request from time to time.</p>
			
			<p>d. Text Messages and Phone Calls. By providing your phone number and using the Platform, you hereby affirmatively consent to our use of your mobile phone number for calls and, if such phone number is a mobile number, for text messages, in order to assist with facilitating the requested Services. Standard call or message charges or other charges from your phone carrier may apply to calls or text messages we send you.</p>
			
			<p>e. Emails. MARCO may send you confirmation and other transactional emails regarding the Services. MARCO may also send you emails about services that we think might interest you (&quot;Promotional Emails&quot;). The Promotional Emails include an option for you to opt out of receiving such emails.</p>
			
			<p><strong>3. Payments.</strong></p>
			
			<p>Customers contract for Services directly with Vendors. MARCO is not a party to any contracts for Services. The Platform facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium through which Customers can connect with Vendors, schedule Services, and make payments for Services (&quot;Payments&quot;). Customers are obligated to pay in advance for the Service they order through the Platform. We will charge your credit card according to the amount agreed upon between you and us through the Platform with respect to all Services, and for all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees or expenses associated with a Service, and you hereby authorize us to charge the credit card on file in your Platform account for such amounts. We will use third party services to process credit card information. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to place a hold on your credit card for an ordered or completed Service transaction. All Payments by Customers must be made through the Platform. No refunds or credits will be provided once the Customer's credit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific promotions, or to correct any errors we have made. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. You will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Service(s) provided (other than taxes based on MARCO's income).</p>
			
			<p>Users authorize the Company to use Stripe (stripe.com), or any other payment processing service provider, for purposes of completing a Transaction, including, but not limited to, processing payments, refunds and adjustments on a User&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
			
			<p><strong>4. Term and Termination; Cancellation of Services; Survival.</strong></p>
			
			<p>a. Term. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until such time as it is terminated by you or by us.</p>
			
			<p>b. Termination by MARCO. We may terminate this Agreement or terminate or suspend your right to use the Platform at any time for any or no reason (including, without limitation, in the event that we believe that you have breached this Agreement or any policy posted on the Platform, or if we otherwise find that you have engaged in inappropriate and/or offensive behavior (collectively, &quot;Prohibited Conduct&quot;)) by providing you with written or email notice of such termination to the physical or email address you have provided us, and termination will be effective immediately upon such notice. Except in the event that we terminate or suspend your right to use the Platform due to any Prohibited Conduct, we will refund in full any unused balance in your account. If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress. When terminating your account, MARCO may delete the account and all the information in it. You have no ownership rights to your account.</p>
			
			<p>c. Termination by You. You may terminate this Agreement by completely and permanently ceasing to use the Platform (provided that there are no outstanding Services ordered under your password or account). If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while there are still outstanding Services ordered under your password or account, this Agreement shall not terminate until such Services have been performed or otherwise canceled as permitted by MARCO.</p>
			
			<p>d. Service Cancellation by Customer. Customers shall cancel their ordered Services appointments pursuant to the cancellation policies of the Vendor from which such Customers ordered Services.</p>
			
			<p>e. Service Cancellation by Vendor. When a Vendor cancels ordered Services, MARCO cannot guarantee that a canceled Service may be provided by another Vendor or rescheduled or that the Service request will be completed. Vendors who cancel a scheduled Service may incur fees or penalties as provided in their Vendor Listing Agreement with us.</p>
			
			<p>f. Survival. All provisions that should by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including without limitation, Sections 8, 10 and 13-20, shall so survive.</p>
			
			<p><strong>5. Links to and Plug-Ins from Other Web Sites or Media.</strong></p>
			
			<p>Links (such as hyperlinks) from the Platform to and plug-ins from sites or applications owned, operated or controlled by third parties (collectively, &quot;Third Party Sites&quot;) do not constitute the endorsement by MARCO of the Third Party Sites or their content. Such links and plug-ins are provided as an information service, for reference and convenience only. MARCO does not control any Third Party Sites, and is not responsible for their content. It is your responsibility to evaluate the content and usefulness of the information obtained from Third Party Sites. The use of any Third Party Site is governed by the terms and conditions of use and privacy policy of that Third Party Site. YOU ACCESS THIRD PARTY SITES AT YOUR OWN RISK. MARCO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE AND/OR VIEWING OF ANY THIRD PARTY SITES, AND YOU HEREBY AGREE TO HOLD MARCO HARMLESS FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT MAY RESULT FROM THIRD PARTY SITES.</p>
			
			<p><strong>6. User Content; Community Areas.</strong> </p>
			
			<p>a. We don't claim ownership of any files, materials, data, text, audio, video, images or other content provided to us by Users for use with MARCO (collectively<strong>, &quot;Content&quot;</strong>) that is transmitted, stored, accessed, or processed through the Services. We also don't verify or endorse any Content that Users provide or otherwise make available on the Platform. Content uploaded, expressed or submitted to the Platform, other than any Content provided by us, is solely the responsibility of the User submitting it and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of MARCO. We are not responsible, or liable to you or any third party, for the content or accuracy of any Content provided by you or any other User. You hereby grant MARCO and its employees and contractors the right, to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, distribute, display and disclose Content you provide to the Platform. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights in your Content necessary for you to use the Platform and to grant the rights in this Paragraph 6(a). You will: (a) be solely responsible for the nature, quality and accuracy of your Content; (b) must ensure that your Content (including the storage or transmission thereof) complies with these Terms of Use and any and all applicable laws, and regulations; (c) promptly handle and resolve any notices and claims relating to your Content, including any notices sent to you or to MARCO by any person claiming that any of your Content violates any person's rights, such as take-down notices pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and any other notices; and (d) maintain appropriate security, protection and backup copies of your Content. MARCO shall have no liability of any kind as a result of the deletion of, correction of, destruction of, damage to, loss of or failure to store or encrypt any of your Content. You must immediately notify MARCO in writing of any unauthorized use of (a) any of your Content, (b) any account, or (c) the Platform that comes to your attention. In the event of any such unauthorized use by any third party that obtained access through you, you will take all steps necessary to terminate such unauthorized use. You will provide MARCO with such cooperation and assistance related to any such unauthorized use as MARCO may reasonably request. </p>
			
			<p>b. The Platform may contain blogs, message boards, applications, reviews, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities and/or other message or communication facilities that allow Users to communicate with other Users or review Vendors (collectively, &quot;Community Areas&quot;). All submissions made to Community Areas within the Platform will be public, and we will not be responsible for any information or materials posted in Community Areas. You may only use such Community Areas to send and receive messages and material that are relevant and proper to the applicable forum and that comply with this Agreement. &quot;Your Information&quot; is defined as any information and materials you provide to us or other Users in connection with your registration for and use of the Platform, including without limitation that are posted or transmitted for use in Community Areas. You are solely responsible for Your Information, and we are merely a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of Your Information. You hereby represent and warrant that Your Information; (a) will comply at all times with this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 7 (Rules for Use of the Platform) below, and with Section 2 (Personal Information; User Accounts) above; and (b) will not create liability for us or cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs, customers, or other partners or suppliers. You hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute all of Your Information that is posted to Community Areas from or through your account on the Platform, including but not limited to all images, videos, musical works and text included in such postings. We reserve the right to remove postings from Community Areas in our sole discretion.</p>
			
			<p>c. We have the right to:</p>
			
			<p>(1) Remove or refuse to post any Content for any or no reason in our sole discretion.</p>
			
			<p>(2) Take any action with respect to any Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe that such Content violates the Agreement, infringes any intellectual property right or other right, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services and the public or could create liability for MARCO.</p>
			
			<p>(3) Disclose your identity to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.</p>
			
			<p>(4) Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Platform. </p>
			
			<p>Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting any Content on or through the Platform. YOU RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS MARCO FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY MARCO DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER COMPANY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.</p>
			
			<p>However, we cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or Content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this paragraph.</p>
			
			<p><strong>7. Rules for Use of the Platform. </strong></p>

			<p><strong>8. No Employment. </strong></p>
			
			<p>Users, including Vendors, do not have authority to enter into contracts or commitments, whether written or oral, implied or express, on behalf of MARCO. You acknowledge that we do not supervise, direct, or control a Vendor's products or Services performed in any manner. Vendors&rsquo; products, websites, and physical locations may contain MARCO insignia purely for the purpose of marketing and of identifying themselves as a provider of Services through the Platform. MARCO is not an employment service and does not serve as an employer of any User. As such, we will not be liable for any tax or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment insurance, employer's liability, social security or payroll withholding tax in connection with a Vendor&rsquo;s provision of Services. Vendors understand and agree that if we are found to be liable for any tax or withholding tax in connection with your provision of Services, then you will immediately reimburse and pay to us an equivalent amount, including any interest or penalties thereon. You further agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend us from any and all claims that a Vendor was misclassified as an independent contractor or an employee (including, but not limited to, taxes, penalties, interest and attorney's fees), any claims that we were an employer or joint employer of a Vendor, and any claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation, overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.</p>
			
			<p><strong>9. Special Promotions. </strong></p>
			
			<p>We may from time to time provide certain promotional opportunities to Customers. All promotions will be run at our sole discretion, and can be activated, modified or removed at any time by us without advance notification.</p>
			
			<p><strong>10. Intellectual Property Rights.</strong></p>
			
			<p>The Platform, and the information, data, content and materials, which it contains (&quot;MARCO Materials&quot;), are the property of MARCO and/or its affiliates and licensors, excluding User-generated content, which MARCO has a right to use. The MARCO Materials are protected from unauthorized copying and dissemination by United States copyright law, trademark law, international conventions, and other intellectual property laws. MARCO and/or its affiliates and licensors are and shall continue to be the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights associated with the MARCO Materials. Any use of MARCO Materials, other than as expressly permitted herein, is prohibited without the prior permission of MARCO and/or the relevant right holder. To the extent you provide any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations, or other information regarding the Platform, you hereby assign to MARCO all right, title and interest thereto. The service marks and trademarks of MARCO, including without limitation <a href="getmarco.co"> www.getmarco.co </a> and the MARCO logo are service marks owned by MARCO. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos and/or trade names appearing on the Platform are the property of their respective owners. You may not copy or use any of the marks, logos or trade names appearing on the Platform without the express prior written consent of the owner.</p>
			
			<p><strong>11. Copyright Complaints and Copyright Agent.</strong></p>
			
			<p>MARCO respects the intellectual property of others, and expects Users to do the same. MARCO will respond to properly submitted notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. In the event that a person or entity has a good faith belief that any materials provided on or in connection with the Platform infringe upon that person or entity's copyright or other intellectual property right (such person or entity, a &quot;Complainant&quot;) and sends to MARCO a properly submitted copyright notice as indicated below, MARCO will investigate, and if it determines, in its discretion, that the material is infringing, MARCO will remove the content and may terminate the access of the User who posted such content to the Platform in the case of repeat infringers. All notices claiming an infringement of copyright rights must contain the following:</p>
			
			<p>(i) Identification of the intellectual property right that is allegedly infringed. All relevant registration numbers, or a statement concerning the Complainant's ownership of the work, should be included.</p>
			
			<p>(ii) A statement specifically identifying the location of the infringing material, with enough detail that MARCO may find it on the Platform.</p>
			
			<p>(iii) The complete name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of Complainant.</p>
			
			<p>(iv) A statement stating that Complainant has a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the owner of the rights, their agents, or by law.</p>
			
			<p>(v) A statement that the information contained in the notification is accurate, and under the penalty of perjury, Complainant is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other property rights that are allegedly infringed;</p>

			<p><strong>16. Arbitration Agreement.</strong></p>
			
			<p>a. Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim, past, present, or future, between you and MARCO, including without limitation any dispute or claim related to or arising out of this Agreement (&quot;Dispute&quot;), you and MARCO may attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally (the &quot;Informal Negotiations&quot;) before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such Informal Negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for any notices under this Section 16 is your email address and/or physical address that you have provided to MARCO. MARCO's address for such notices is: <a href="mailto:support@getmarco.co">support@getmarco.co</a> and/or by mail to Somerset Networks, Inc., Attn: Legal, PO BOX 60, Santa Barbara, CA 93102.</p>
			
			<p>b. Arbitration. If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations, you and MARCO agree to resolve any and all Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) through final and binding arbitration (&quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot;). The arbitration will be commenced and conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the AAA website (www.adr.org). Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of you and MARCO. Unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the state where the arbitration proceeding will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. If for any reason the parties cannot agree to an arbitrator, either party, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.6, may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction, with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted, for appointment of a neutral arbitrator. Each party will pay the fees for his/her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing. Additionally, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the &quot;Class Action Waiver&quot; described in Section d below.</p>
			
			<p>c. Excluded Disputes. You and MARCO agree that the following Disputes are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (1) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or our intellectual property rights; (2) individual claims in small claims court; (3) any claim that an applicable federal statute expressly states cannot be arbitrated; and (4) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
			
			<p>d. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION. You and MARCO agree to bring any Dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action. There will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action (&quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;). Regardless of anything else in this Arbitration Agreement, the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Class Action Waiver may only be determined by a court and not an arbitrator.</p>
			
			<p>e. Rules/Standards Governing Arbitration Proceeding. A party who wishes to arbitrate a Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement must initiate an arbitration proceeding by delivery of a written demand by hand or first class mail to the other party no later than the expiration of the statute of limitations that applicable law prescribes for the claim asserted. The arbitrator shall apply the statute of limitations that would have applied if the Dispute had been brought in court. The demand for arbitration shall include identification of the parties, a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s), and a specification of the remedy sought. (In cases where the plaintiff first files a complaint in court instead of a written demand to arbitrate, the responding party&rsquo;s written demand for arbitration need not include a statement as to the basis of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims(s) or the remedy sought.) The arbitrator may award any remedy to which a party is entitled under applicable law, but remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in their individual capacity, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual under applicable law will be forfeited. The arbitrator is without authority to apply any different substantive law. The parties have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any dispute in this regard shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall take place in Santa Barbara County, California, unless each party agrees otherwise. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator's decision/award.</p>
			
			<p>f. Severability. You and MARCO agree that if any portion of this section entitled &quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot; is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of this section 16 will be given full force and effect.</p>
			
			<p><strong>17. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
			
			<p>This Agreement is governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of California, United States of America, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law. For all Disputes not subject to arbitration, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within the county of Santa Barbara, California.</p>
			
			<p><strong>18. Assignment.</strong></p>
			
			<p>This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by you without our prior written approval. We may assign or transfer this Agreement without your consent, including but not limited to assignments: (i) to a parent or subsidiary, (ii) to an acquirer of assets, or (iii) to any other successor or acquirer. Any assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of permitted successors and assigns.</p>
			
			<p><strong>19. General Provisions.</strong></p>
			
			<p>No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. A failure by us to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and MARCO with respect to its subject matter. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will be enforced to the fullest extent possible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any Dispute, claim or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such Dispute, claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. All notices provided by a party in connection with this Agreement will be deemed given as of the day they are received either by email, messenger, delivery service, or in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, certified or registered, return receipt requested, and addressed as follows: Your address for such notices is your email address and/or physical address that you have provided to MARCO. MARCO's address for such notices is: <a href="mailto:support@getmarco.co">support@getmarco.co</a> and/or by mail to Somerset Networks, Inc., Attn: Legal, PO BOX 60, Santa Barbara, CA 93102. The captions in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be modified except in writing signed by both parties or by means of a new posting by MARCO, as described below. This Agreement shall be interpreted as if jointly drafted by the parties. MARCO shall have no liability to you for any failure or delay in performing its obligations in this Agreement where such failure or delay is caused by an event or circumstance beyond MARCO's reasonable control including, without limitation, strikes, lock-outs and other industrial disputes, breakdown of systems or network access, failure of Vendors to perform, flood, fire, explosion, acts of terrorism or accident.</p>
