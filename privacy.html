			<p>Somerset Networks, Inc. a Delaware corporation d/b/a MARCO (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices for Company’s website <a href="getmarco.co"> www.getmarco.co </a>, or the “Site”), the MARCO mobile application (the “App”, and collectively with the Site, “MARCO”), and the services and products available through MARCO (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Services, regardless of how you access them.<strong>  By using the Site, the App, or any of the Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy</strong>. These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Site or use the App to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>

		<section>
		<h4>Collection of Information</h4>
		
		<p>Information may be collected from you in various ways when you use the Services. We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with MARCO, the Services and other communications. This information includes your computer or digital device’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and accessed pages. Company uses unique identifiers [and Google Analytics] to measure usage and analyze trends, administer the website and collect information for its databases. [To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, visit  <a href="www.google.com/analytics"> www.google.com/analytics</a>, and to learn how to opt out of that service, visit <a href="tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"> tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>].</p>
		
		<p>We receive and store any information you enter through MARCO or any of the Services, or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications with our customer service department. If you contact us for support, we will keep an internal record of what support was given.</p>
		
			<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> we collect may include the user’s operating system, type of web browser, IP address, referring pages, and frequency of visits. This information is used to analyze how visitors use MARCO in order to make future improvements. To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. Company also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, browser type and browser version, cookies, and other unique identifying information of machines that access MARCO. This information is used for the operation of MARCO, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our Services. All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers.</p>
		
			<p><strong>Personal Information</strong> collected from users of the Services may include first and last name, phone number, physical address, email address, comments, payment information (including your account or credit card number), a password, and permission from the user to add him/her to our mailing list. You are solely responsible for safeguarding the secrecy of your password and for promptly notifying us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and update our records accordingly.</p>
		
		<p>All personal information remains private within Company and is not distributed or sold to any outside organizations except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may use your personal information to provide you with Services, features and functionality or to contact you regarding Services. Your email address may be used to send you periodic product newsletters, offers and usage tips from Company. You can opt out of promotional emails at any time, but will still receive communications such as receipts, confirmation emails and customer service updates that are considered necessary to provide Services to you. We use the information collected to deliver and improve Services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products, updates and Services, personalize and improve your experience, and generally maintain your accounts with us. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you Services and to communicate with you about Services and products. While your account is active and even after it has been closed, we will retain your personal information as long as we deem it reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you Services, contact us at <a href="mailto: support@getmarco.co"> support@getmarco.co</a>. Deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely.</p>
		
		<p>Since MARCO and the Services are not directed to persons under 18, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their consent, he or she should delete the account. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will suspend the account. For assistance, contact our support department.</p>

		<h4>Cookie/Tracking Technology</h4>
		
		<p>MARCO may use cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered. Cookie and tracking technology are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Site and users of the App, and understanding how users use MARCO. Cookies can also help customize MARCO for users. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology, however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. You can use your browser settings to instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies you may not be able to use all portions of MARCO or all of the functionalities of the Services.</p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section>
		<h4>Sharing of Information and Files</h4>
		
		<p>One of the primary reasons people use MARCO is to provide information regarding rental products to other users. When you choose to provide images, specifications, and other files and data (“Files”) through MARCO, Company will collect and store this information on its servers. Some information is retained only as long as necessary to provide requested Services; other information may be retained longer so we may continue to provide the Services, comply with our legal obligations and enforce our agreements. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with Files you share on MARCO (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the Files.</p>
		
		<p>Company is not responsible if you volunteer personal information or Files online that are accessible to all or some of the public. Any personal information or Files you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you and your products. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties or your information and Files may be used in a manner that violates the law, your personal privacy or your safety. By submitting such information and Files, you assume the risks and sole liability arising as a result of such information and Files being displayed. You understand that any shared Files may be re-shared or copied. We cannot ensure that information you share on the Site or through the Services will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any of our security measures. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.</p>

		<h4>Distribution of Information</h4>
		
		<p>We will not rent, sell or share your information with third parties without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with ICANN’s rules, regulations and policies.</p>
		
		<p>We may share certain personal information we collect about you with our service providers who perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance and customer service. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose personal information except as needed to perform their functions or comply with legal requirements, and they may not use it for any other purpose. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).</p>
		
		<p>In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, Company may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred or used.</p>
		</section>

		<h4>Third Parties</h4>
		
		<p>Third-party websites, applications, or services linked to MARCO are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These websites, applications, or services may collect personally identifiable information about you and place a cookie on your browser. Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of the third-party websites and companies or what they do with your information. You should make sure their privacy policies are acceptable to you.

		<section class="security-policy">
		<h4>Security Policy</h4>
		
		<p>The security of your information is important to us. Company employs measures to protect information collected from loss, destruction, disclosure, unauthorized access, misuse and alteration. Although we strive to protect your personal information, Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
		
		<p>We have partnered with leading payment gateways Stripe to offer safe and secure credit card and electronic check transactions for our customers. Stripe, and not Company, is responsible for the security of these transactions. The Stripe payment gateway manages the complex routing of sensitive customer information through the credit card and electronic check processing networks. For additional information regarding the privacy of your sensitive cardholder data, please read the Stripe Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
